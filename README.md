Customer Purchase Behavior in Retail using Data Analytics
For this project, I have created a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation for each software tool usedâ€”Excel, SQL, and Power BI. Each PowerPoint explains the project's approach, key methodologies, and insights gained from using these tools. These presentations provide a detailed walkthrough of the data analysis and visualization process, ensuring a clear understanding of how each tool contributed to the project's outcomes.
